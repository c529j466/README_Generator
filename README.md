# <CLI Read_Me Generator>

## Description

For this project, I was tasked with creating a generator for markdown documents that is created from a series of prompts through the command line. The project also needed the functionality of a linked table of contents, badges for the license selected in the prompts, and a linked github username. The page functioned in that when a user opens their terminal to install the npm packages and then starts the generator, a series of questions will be asked through the command line, and based on the user's answers to those questions, a markdown file is created with their responses. My motivation to complete this project was to better understand how to apply the use of npm packages and javascript to create files based on user responses. This project was also useful because it is something that I can later use in my future projects to generate the markdown documents for my repository ReadMes.

## Installation

To install the Read_Me generator, a user would need to download the files from the repository to their local system, run npm install to pull in the needed dependencies for the generator, and then run npm start to begin the prompts for the markdown contents.

## Credits

I recieved help on this project from my instructors, Henery Winget and Chris Sinlasath. I also used shields.io for the badge icons.
